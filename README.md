## Introduction

**This is official implementation of *Resnet50* neural network**

> Neural network is the best algorithm that human kind ever invented  
> *By Nekoj So Ime i prezime*


The following modules were part of Data Science academy 

1. Big Data
2. Machine Learning
    - Neural Networks
    - PCA
    - TSNE
    - K-Means
    - Sk-Learn
3. Python
    - For loops
    - While loops
    - if/else



The most useful code snippet that improved our accuracy was the foolowing : 
 
```
sum = 0
for i in range(200):
    print("hello world", i)
    sum = sum+i

b = 100
a = 100
```

## Conclusion 

The following bugs were fixed : 
 * ~~Unusual crash~~
 * ~~No memory leaks~~

We tried sevral algorithms for training machine learning models:
 - [x] Xception
 - [X] Resnet50
 - [ ] VGG
 - [ ] DenseNet
